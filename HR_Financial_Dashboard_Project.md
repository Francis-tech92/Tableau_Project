## Project Overview
The goal of this data analysis project is to provide insights into XYZ Company's HR performance by analyzing various HR datasets. The primary focus is to identify trends in employee attrition, offer data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of how employee attrition relates to job satisfaction and educational attainment.

## Data Sources
- **HR Data.xlsx**: The primary dataset used for this project, containing detailed information about employee performance, attrition, and the overall attrition rate within XYZ Company.

## Data Analytics Tools
The following tools were utilized for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization:

- **MS Excel**: Used for initial data cleaning tasks, including formatting and handling missing values.
- **Tableau**: Used for conducting data analysis, creating visualizations, and building interactive dashboards.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for HR performance and attrition analysis.
- Interactive Tableau dashboards for visualizing employee attrition and job satisfaction trends.
- Actionable insights for improving employee retention and satisfaction.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
During the data preparation phase, the following steps were taken:
1. **Data Loading and Inspection**: Reviewed the dataset to understand its structure and content.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Managed any missing data by either imputing or removing incomplete records.
3. **Formatting and Data Cleansing**: Ensured the dataset was clean and ready for analysis by standardizing formats, correcting data types, and removing outliers or errors.

## Usage
1. **Data Cleaning**: Open the dataset in MS Excel and follow the data cleaning steps outlined.
2. **Data Analysis**: Use Tableau to load the cleaned dataset and explore the pre-built visualizations or customize them for deeper insights.
3. **Dashboard Exploration**: Interact with the Tableau dashboards to drill down into specific departments, attrition rates, and satisfaction trends.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA focused on addressing the following key questions:
- **Which departments have the highest employee attrition rate?**
- **What are the trends in job satisfaction across the company?**
- **Which departments have the highest employee count?**

## Results/Findings
Some of the insights drawn from the analysis include:
- Identification of departments with the highest attrition rates.
- Job satisfaction trends over time, providing actionable insights into improving employee retention.
- Understanding of employee distribution across different departments and its relationship to attrition.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to XYZ Company to improve HR performance and employee retention:

1. **Invest in Employee Development Programs**: Offering continuous learning and development opportunities, especially during high-attrition periods, can help boost job satisfaction and reduce turnover.
2. **Focus on Departments with High Attrition Rates**: Target departments experiencing the highest attrition with specific retention strategies such as better management practices or improving working conditions.
3. **Implement Employee Satisfaction Surveys**: Regularly gather feedback through surveys to measure job happiness and identify areas for improvement before attrition spikes.

## Dependencies
